I"¥<p>Exometeorologists have managed to create a map of the clouds on a planet outside our solar system for the first time.</p>

<p>Kepler-7b is a massive, gaseous giant of a planet â€“ like a scaled-up version of Jupiter. It has a surface temperature of around 1400C, but thatâ€™s relatively cool considering it sits far closer to its star than Earth does - just 0.06 astronomical units away.</p>

<p>As such, itâ€™s easy to spot when itâ€™s passing that star, and by training the Spitzer and Kepler space telescopes on it for three years, a team at MIT have been able to map its cloud structures. It has high clouds in its western hemisphere, and clearer skies in the east.</p>
